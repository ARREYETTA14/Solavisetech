- You have created a resource through terraform
- User(s) made changed on the resource both infra and inside server

There are two ways you can handle this 
- Delete and recreate the resource as it originally was (tainting)
- Import the changes to terraform


* Tainting
- you created an ec2 instance with instance type t2.micro
- at the console, it was changed to t2.medium
- when you run "terrafrom taint" it takes the changes made in console and marks as tainted.
- when you run "terraform plan & apply", terraform destroys all the resources that were tainted 
  then it recreated the initial resource with t2.micro.

* Import
- In case we wish to keep the changes, we can import the changes from console such that, it upates
  the statefile. "terraform refresh"
- The terraform statefile will have t2.medium and now we just have to update backend code
  t2.medium.
